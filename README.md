## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 14+ (for production)

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Path-based routing for multiple apps
- ✅ Health checks for all services
- ✅ Resource limits and isolation
- ✅ Easy to add new apps
- ✅ Centralized Nginx reverse proxy

**Quick Commands:**
```bash
# List all apps
bash scripts/manage-apps.sh list

# Check health of all apps
bash scripts/manage-apps.sh health

# Start/stop specific app
bash scripts/manage-apps.sh start backend
bash scripts/manage-apps.sh stop frontend

# View logs
bash scripts/manage-apps.sh logs backend
```

**Adding a New App:**
See [docs/ADD_NEW_APP_GUIDE.md](./docs/ADD_NEW_APP_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.
