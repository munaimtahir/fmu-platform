## Key Talking Points (Memorize These)

1. **Problem Statement:** "We currently manage student information across paper files, spreadsheets, and manual processes. This is slow, error-prone, and makes reporting difficult."

2. **Solution:** "SIMS replaces these manual processes with a secure digital system that all authorized staff can access online."

3. **Value Proposition:** "The system reduces errors, saves time, improves reporting, and provides better oversight."

4. **Readiness:** "The core system works and is ready for pilot testing, but we need proper preparation before full deployment."

5. **Recommendation:** "We recommend starting with a pilot program involving one program for 4 months to test and refine before expanding."

6. **Investment:** "One-time setup costs are $17,000 to $35,000, with ongoing costs of $15,000 to $34,000 per year, typically recovered through efficiency gains within 2-3 years."

7. **Risk Management:** "All risks are manageable with our phased approach, thorough training, and parallel operation during pilot."

8. **Decision Needed:** "We need approval to proceed with pilot program, select the pilot program, approve the budget, and assign a project coordinator."

## Conclusion

This presentation structure provides a clear, non-technical path through the decision process. It acknowledges challenges honestly while making a compelling case for moving forward with appropriate caution.

**Remember:** Your audience cares about operational improvement and institutional value, not technical implementation details. Keep the focus on benefits, risks, and the path forward.
