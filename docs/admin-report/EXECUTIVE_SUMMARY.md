# Executive Summary

The Student Information Management System (SIMS) is a university‑wide platform for Faisalabad Medical University that replaces paper records with a single system for admissions, enrollment, attendance, assessments, results, and student fees. It is designed for administrators, registrars, faculty, finance teams, exam staff, coordinators, and students.

**Value to the institution**

- Core functions for student records, enrollment, attendance, assessments, results, and finance are present.
- Administration tools exist for managing users, access, and system settings.
- Some supporting features are still limited, such as password changes, settings history, and reporting depth.

**Next actions**
- Approve a small pilot in one or two programs.
- Complete missing user support features (password change and clear reset process).
- Expand reporting coverage for attendance and activity to match institutional needs.
- Provide role‑based training and confirm data readiness before full rollout.
