## 🔍 WHAT WAS NOT DONE

### Could Not Verify (System Not Running)

- ❌ Actual system startup
- ❌ Runtime performance testing
- ❌ Email notification verification
- ❌ Real-time WebSocket functionality
- ❌ Background job processing
- ❌ Data export actual execution
- ❌ Load testing under real conditions
- ❌ Integration with external systems (if any)

**Reason**: Infrastructure block prevents startup

**Impact**: Medium - These can be tested during pilot

**Mitigation**: Include in pilot test plan

---

### Deliberately Out of Scope

- ✅ No code refactoring (not required)
- ✅ No new feature development
- ✅ No redesign of interfaces
- ✅ No infrastructure changes beyond fix
- ✅ No custom development

**Reason**: Focus was verification, not modification

---

## 💡 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Went Well ✅

1. **Existing Screenshots**: Having 50+ production screenshots was invaluable
2. **Good Documentation**: Repository has excellent existing docs
3. **Clear Structure**: Well-organized codebase made review easier
4. **Professional Code**: High-quality implementation evident

### What Was Challenging ⚠️

1. **Cannot Run**: Infrastructure block prevented live testing
2. **Evidence Limitations**: Had to rely on screenshots vs. live interaction
3. **Performance Unknown**: Cannot assess speed/responsiveness
4. **Email Unverified**: Cannot test notification system

### What Could Be Better 📝

1. **Pre-Built Images**: Docker images could be pre-built elsewhere
2. **Alternative Builds**: Instructions for non-Docker deployment
3. **Test Environment**: Separate test server with working SSL
4. **Runtime Tests**: Automated test suite for verification
