# System Overview

## What is FMU SIMS?

FMU SIMS (Student Information Management System) is a digital platform that manages all student records and administrative processes for Faisalabad Medical University. Think of it as a comprehensive filing system that replaces paper folders, manual record books, and spreadsheets with a secure online system.

## Who is it for?

This system serves Faisalabad Medical University, which includes:
- **Medical College** - five graduate medical programs

The system is designed for daily use by administrators, registrar staff, faculty members, finance officers, exam coordinators, and students.

## High-Level Description

FMU SIMS is a web-based system that runs in your internet browser. Staff members log in with their username and password to access different functions based on their role. The system organizes information around the student lifecycle:

1. **Admission & Enrollment** - When a student joins the university, their basic information is entered into the system including which program they are studying and which batch (year group) they belong to.

2. **Academic Management** - The system tracks which courses students are taking, their class schedules, and which faculty members are teaching them.

3. **Attendance Tracking** - Teachers mark student attendance electronically, and the system automatically calculates attendance percentages.

4. **Examinations & Results** - Exam scores are entered and grades are calculated automatically following university rules. Results go through a verification workflow before becoming final.

5. **Financial Management** - Fee vouchers are generated automatically, payments are recorded, and the system tracks which students have outstanding balances.

6. **Document Requests** - Students can request transcripts and certificates through the system, which tracks the approval process.

The system enforces university policies automatically. For example, it prevents issuing transcripts to students with unpaid fees, or blocks enrollment for students who don't meet attendance requirements.

## Institutional Context

This system supports the academic and administrative operations of a medical university with regulatory oversight from:
- **Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC)** - for medical programs
- **Higher Education Commission (HEC)** - for all programs

The system is designed to help the university meet reporting requirements for these regulatory bodies while improving efficiency of day-to-day operations.
