# Recommendation & Next Steps (Decision‑Focused)

## Pilot Use
- **Suitable for a limited pilot** focused on a small set of programs or departments, because core academic and finance workflows are present.

## Must Be Completed Before Full Rollout
- Enable a self‑service password change option for all users.
- Decide how password resets will be communicated (email or formal handover process).
- Expand attendance and activity summaries to cover the reporting periods the institution needs (monthly and term‑level).
- Add a history view for system settings so leadership can review past policy changes.
- Add bulk user update options for large intakes.

## Support Required
- **Training:** Short role‑based training for administrators, registrars, faculty, finance staff, and students.
- **Data readiness:** Confirm student lists, programs, and academic periods before pilot.
- **Policy alignment:** Agree on rules for attendance locking, result publication, and fee clearance.
