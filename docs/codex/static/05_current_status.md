# What the System Can Do Today vs What Is Pending

## ✔ Ready / Implemented
- Student records, programs, courses, sections, and academic periods are organized in the system.
- Enrollment workflows, including bulk enrollment, are available for staff.
- Attendance entry and eligibility checks are available for faculty and administrators.
- Assessments, gradebook views, and results screens are available, including result publishing.
- Finance workflows exist for fee plans, vouchers, payments, and finance reports.
- Administration tools exist for user management, role access, audit activity, and settings.
- Dashboards provide system‑level summaries for administrators.

## ⏳ Planned / Incomplete / Needs Work
- **Password changes:** The change‑password option is listed as “coming soon,” so users cannot change passwords from the menu yet.
- **User support workflow:** Password reset provides a temporary password but does not send it automatically, so staff must share it manually.
- **Bulk user operations:** User management does not yet support bulk create or bulk updates.
- **Audit activity depth:** Admin activity history is limited in how many recent items it shows.
- **Attendance summaries:** The attendance summary covers only the most recent week, which may be too short for some reporting needs.
- **System info accuracy:** The system version shown on the admin dashboard is fixed text and may not update automatically.
- **Settings history:** Settings changes do not keep a history, so administrators cannot review past values.
