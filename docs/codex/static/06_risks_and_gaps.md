# Risks, Gaps & Administrative Concerns

- **Manual password sharing:** When a password is reset, staff must manually send the temporary password to the user, which increases workload and the chance of delays.
- **Limited audit review:** The activity list on the admin dashboard shows only a small number of recent items, which may not be enough for full review.
- **Short attendance window:** Attendance summaries focus on only the most recent week, which may not meet monthly or term‑level reporting needs.
- **No settings history:** Changes to system settings do not keep past values, which makes it harder to trace policy changes over time.
- **No bulk user updates:** User accounts must be managed one by one, which can be slow during large intakes.
- **Change‑password not available:** Users cannot change their own passwords yet, which may create support requests.
