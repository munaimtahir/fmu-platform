# System Overview (Plain English)

The system is a Student Information Management System (SIMS) for Faisalabad Medical University (FMU). It replaces paper files with a single, secure place to manage student records and academic workflows across medical and allied health programs.

In simple terms, it helps the university track a student’s journey from admission to graduation. It brings together admissions, enrollment, attendance, assessments, results, and finance in one place so staff and leadership can see progress and make decisions with clear, up‑to‑date information.
